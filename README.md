This project involves exploring family history data using Python. It utilizes two CSV files: one containing fictional ancestors and another with fun facts about significant events from the years of those ancestors. 
The project includes a main Python file and a test file to ensure functionality.

The project offers four key activities:

Calculate an ancestor's age at a historical event
Sort the list of ancestors
Add a new ancestor to the list
Retrieve a fun fact about the year an ancestor was born
